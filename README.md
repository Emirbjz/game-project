#### Video Demo:  <https://vimeo.com/762715452/ba9d5e1179>
#### Description:
Made a pong game using son graphics with Lua.
The main folder is divide into six sections.

-assets folder : containing the images used for the game.
-main.lua : for the main functions of the game.
-ai.lua : describing the way the AI is going to move during the game, limitation and the way it looks.
-player.lua: describing the way we move the main paddle, the limitation and the way it looks.
-ball.lua: describing the way the ball moves, the physics for the ball and the way you can score during the game.
-background.lua: to display the background for the game.

I started the project using a simple rectangle and try to create the behaviour for the whole game.
After all the code for that was made, i finished the project with some assets that i made using krita so it's not just a rectangle.
You use the W and S keys to move up and down.
once the ball hits the end of the screen you or the AI will get a point.

I will work on my skills in order to improve this in the future
and add more things to make the game better for the player.
